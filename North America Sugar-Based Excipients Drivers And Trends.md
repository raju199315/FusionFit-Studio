<p><h2>North America Sugar-Based Excipients Market Driver and Trends</h2><p>The growing demand for oral solid dosage forms in North America is one of the key drivers for the sugar-based excipients market. Sugar excipients, especially in the form of binders, fillers, and flavor enhancers, are increasingly used in the formulation of tablets and capsules due to their excellent taste-masking properties and ease of manufacturing. With the rise in the prevalence of chronic diseases and the increasing demand for over-the-counter medications, pharmaceutical manufacturers are focusing on developing sugar-based formulations to improve patient compliance and enhance product stability, further boosting the market growth.</p><p>Another major trend driving the market is the shift toward the use of natural and organic sugar excipients. As consumers become more health-conscious, there is a growing preference for excipients derived from natural sources, such as corn, wheat, and sugarcane. This shift is also driven by the increasing regulatory pressure for more sustainable and environmentally friendly products. Moreover, advancements in sugar excipient technology, including the development of novel sugar alcohols and enhanced functionalities, are allowing manufacturers to meet the evolving needs of the pharmaceutical industry, thus stimulating the market’s expansion in North America.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=33216&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">North AmericaSugar-Based Excipients Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaSugar-Based Excipients Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Sugar-Based Excipients Market size was valued at USD 2.15 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 3.51 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaSugar-Based Excipients Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Ashland</Li><Li> ADM</Li><Li> BASF</Li><Li> DFE Pharma</Li><Li> Roquette</Li><Li> Associated British Foods</Li><Li> Cargill</Li><Li> Colorcon</Li><Li> FMC</Li><Li> Lubrizol</Li><Li> Meggle</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;North AmericaSugar-Based Excipients Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the North AmericaSugar-Based Excipients Market apart.
